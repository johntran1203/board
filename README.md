# Project Overview

## Project Name

OC Charcuterie Board 

## Project Description
My project is where people can order a Charcuterie Board. My friend start a side hustle on instagram and facbook marketplace and I decide to make them a website. 

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## Component Hierarchy

Show your component hierarchy here! Use [this](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1795/posts/30352/image/GettingStartedWithReduxTutorial-React-Component-Structure.png) as an example.

## ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

Show us the relations between your tables (there must be three minimum), as well as their fields! Use [this](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-den-osos/data-modeling-intro-lesson#entity-relationship-diagrams-erds) as an example! In addition, please indicate which table will be used for full CRUD.

## Additional Technologies

If you plan on using technologies outside of the scope of the course's content, please add them here. If you have developed any prototypes to test the technology, you can link them here as well if you'd like feedback.

## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Create application and deploy it on Heroku and Netlify
- Application will have CRUD funtionaloty
- Render appiycation in browser
- Build a back End with python using the Flask framework, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints
- build 3 tables and 1 association between your tables
- build at least 8 components
- style my application, use flexbox or Grid and implement media queries


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- have a people feedback post on my website
- A constant  CSS changing them during the four season
- Add a hamburger menu
- Add a second API
- maybe a subscribe email to our newsletter or promotion

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths: Front-end and CSS

#### Weaknesses: Connecting the front-end and the back-end

#### Opportunities: To work more with Python

#### Threats: Time management and the fear of not graduating
